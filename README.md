I've created a complete e-commerce application with the following features:

Products Page:

Fetches products from the Fake Store API
Displays products in a responsive grid
Add to cart functionality
Loading state while fetching products
Cart Page:

Shows all items added to cart
Option to remove items
Displays total amount
Empty cart message when no items
Navigation:

Cart icon with item count
Navigation between products and cart pages
Redux Implementation:

Uses Redux Toolkit for state management
Separate slice for cart functionality
Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
The application is now running and you can:

View products on the home page
Add products to cart
See the cart count update in the navbar
Navigate to the cart page
Remove items from the cart
The UI is fully responsive and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and professional look.

To Install dependencies
npm install

Then to run the project
npm run dev
